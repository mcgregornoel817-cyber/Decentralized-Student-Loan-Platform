# 📚 Decentralized Student Loan Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 solution for student loans! This project uses the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to create a decentralized identity system that links loan repayments to verified employment outcomes, specifically targeting low-income borrowers. By leveraging blockchain for transparent identity verification and automated, income-contingent repayments, it reduces default risks, promotes financial inclusion, and ensures fair lending practices without relying on centralized credit bureaus.

## ✨ Features

🔑 Decentralized identity (DID) registration for borrowers to prove education and eligibility  
💼 Verified employment outcomes via oracles for income-based repayment triggers  
📉 Automated loan adjustments: Reduce or defer payments for low-income periods  
🏦 Secure loan issuance and disbursement using tokenized funds  
🔄 Transparent repayment tracking with immutable records  
⚖️ Dispute resolution mechanism for employment claims  
📊 Governance for community-driven updates to loan parameters  
🚫 Fraud prevention through multi-contract verification  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Borrowers**  
- Register your decentralized identity with proof of education and low-income status.  
- Apply for a loan by submitting verifiable credentials (e.g., diplomas, income history).  
- Once approved, receive funds via smart contract escrow.  
- Link your profile to employment verifiers; repayments automatically adjust based on income thresholds (e.g., no payments below a certain salary).  
- Make payments through the platform, with records stored immutably.  

**For Lenders/Investors**  
- Fund loans through a pooled token system.  
- Monitor borrower outcomes via public dashboards.  
- Earn yields based on successful repayments, with risk mitigated by outcome linkages.  

**For Verifiers/Oracles**  
- Submit employment data (e.g., job status, salary) to trigger contract events.  
- Use the system to confirm or dispute claims securely.  

This setup solves real-world issues like student debt crises by making repayments flexible and tied to actual earnings, reducing burdens on low-income individuals while providing lenders with verifiable data.

## 🔗 Smart Contracts Overview

The project is built with 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts for modularity, security, and scalability:  

1. **IdentityRegistry.clar**: Handles decentralized identity registration, storing hashed credentials and verifying borrower eligibility (e.g., low-income status via self-attested proofs).  

2. **BorrowerProfile.clar**: Manages borrower profiles, including education history, loan applications, and links to employment data.  

3. **LoanIssuance.clar**: Issues loans as NFTs or fungible tokens, defining terms like principal, interest, and outcome-based clauses.  

4. **EmploymentOracle.clar**: Integrates with external oracles to fetch and validate employment data (e.g., job confirmation, salary levels) without central trust.  

5. **RepaymentEngine.clar**: Automates repayments by calculating amounts based on verified income; triggers deferrals or reductions for low earners.  

6. **EscrowVault.clar**: Holds loan funds in escrow during disbursement and repayments, ensuring secure transfers.  

7. **DisputeResolution.clar**: Allows parties to raise and resolve disputes over employment claims, with voting or arbitration logic.  

8. **GovernanceToken.clar**: Manages DAO-like governance for updating parameters (e.g., income thresholds), using tokenized voting rights.  

These contracts interact via cross-contract calls, ensuring data integrity and automation on the Stacks blockchain. For example, the RepaymentEngine queries the EmploymentOracle to adjust payment schedules dynamically.  

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Set up a Stacks development environment with Clarity.  
2. Deploy the contracts in sequence (start with IdentityRegistry).  
3. Test interactions using the Clarity REPL or a local node.  
4. Integrate front-end dApps for user-friendly borrowing and verification.
